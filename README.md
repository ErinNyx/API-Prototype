# API-Prototype
 
PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU GRADE

This assignment was done in NodeJS, this language's output is completely done in a Command Prompt. If you need a demonstration, please do not hesitate to ask. You will need to install NodeJS onto your local machine if you want to do it yourself. I didn't realise this until just now and forgot to ask you in class. I will send you an email right now to see if this will be an issue but I am submitting before I do this just in case you don't see the email.

The command to run this project is `node app.js`
Simply open a command prompt and navigate to the API Prototype directory and then type that in. It will run the project and should run as expected.
